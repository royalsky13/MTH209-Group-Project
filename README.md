Hello Reader!!! Welcome to our project repository, this is the folder where we house all of our code. Here is a quick runthrough of all the files present in this folder.

1. `Data Collection & Cleaning`
   This folder contains various files that house the code that we used to clean the data that we used in our analysis for the project. The files are named according to their function.
2. `Report`

3. `Plots and Visualisation`
   This contains some relevant plots used in Report.
4. `Statistical Data Analysis`
   It contains all the code we used to perform various Data Analysis techniques.
